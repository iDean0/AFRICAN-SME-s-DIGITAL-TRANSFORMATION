# AFRICAN-SME-s-DIGITAL-TRANSFORMATION

## Overview
This project analyzes the level of digital transformation among Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) across African countries using Power BI. The objective is to understand how digital adoption influences business growth, funding outcomes, and operational efficiency.

The analysis is presented through three interactive dashboards designed to support business, policy, and investment decisions.

## Project Objectives
- Analyze digital adoption levels among SMEs
- Compare adoption patterns across countries and sectors
- Examine the relationship between digital adoption and business growth
- Evaluate funding status versus growth performance
- Identify the most commonly used digital tools
- Highlight key barriers to digital transformation

## Dataset Information
**Source:** Kaggle – African SME Digital Transformation Dataset  

## Data Preparation & Modeling
Data cleaning and transformation were performed in Power BI using Power Query and DAX:

- Cleaned and standardized categorical values
- Split multi-value digital tools field for accurate analysis
- Created calculated columns and measures for:
  - Adoption distribution
  - Growth performance
  - Tool usage frequency
  - Funding vs growth comparison
- Single-table analytical model used for simplicity and performance
